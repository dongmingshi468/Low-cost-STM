# Low-cost-STM
By using common materials and simple operations, we can build a low-cost scanning tunneling microscope (costing about $400) that achieves atomic-level scanning images. It captures nicely arranged hexagonal structures of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The 
system can automatically adjust the probe distance within a certain range to get the corresponding tunneling current while avoiding damage to the probe tip from the sample. For the probe tip, we can use a regulated power supply to electrochemically etch tungsten wire for 
high-quality, low-cost testing probes.
